        <h1>Fresh Lobster </h1>
       
        <p>
            Live lobsters are very perishable, and require a controlled salt water environment to remain alive.
            They do not generally live much more than a day out of water, so ideally, you should cook your lobsters on the day you receive them.
            (Cooked lobsters will stay fresh for at least three days in the refrigerator.)
        </p> 

        <p>Never place lobsters in tap water to try to keep them alive; lobsters are salt water creatures, and fresh will kill them.</p>

        <p>
            The best way to keep lobsters alive at home is to refrigerate them; cover your lobsters with moist seaweed or a damp cloth
            (which you probably received with the lobsters when they were delivered), and leave them in the refrigerator until ready to cook.
        </p>

        <h2>How can you tell if your lobsters arrived alive?</h2>

        <p>
            If you ordered live lobsters, they will have been out of water for almost 24 hours when you receive them. Occasionally, one may appear weak or lifeless.
            This is a normal occurrence. In most cases, as long as the packaging material is in good condition, and the refrigerant is still cold,
            your lobsters will be fine. The best way to check is to boil the lobster. As long as the lobster’s tail curls when cooked, and the meat in the tail is firm,
            and in one piece, then the lobster was alive when it was cooked.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because lobsters require careful packing and prompt shipping, you should only purchase lobsters from a company which offers a 100% guarantee
            if any lobsters arrive in poor condition.
