        <h1>  ALL ORDERS ARE SHIPPED OVERNIGHT BY FEDEX FOR $59 FOR YOUR ENTIRE ORDER.</h1>

        <p>
            That means whether you order 2 lobsters or 20, you won't pay more than a $59 flat rate for priority overnight shipping
            (except for special Saturday delivery which is $20 extra).

            Few gifts are as unique and as appreciated as lobster or a selection of highest quality seafood. If you haven't been given a
            live lobster before (or ordered one for yourself), then you're in for some wonderful eating.
        </p>

        <p>
            We've perfected our method of packing and shipping so that the lobsters and other seafood you receive will be as fresh as possible.
            Here's what you or the lucky recipient can expect the day that the order arrives.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <p>
            FedEx will deliver your package Priority or Standard Overnight, typically by NOON (deliveries to more remote destinations sometimes arrive as late as 4:30 PM; FedEx tracking data will state estimated delivery time). Although FedEx will leave the package without a signature, please make every effort to ensure that someone will be home later that same day to unpack the lobsters and put them into the refrigerator.
            Inside the reinforced outer box will be a sturdy foam cooler, which holds your lobsters or seafood together with cold packs to ensure their freshness during transport.
            If you ordered chowder, bisque, clams and/or other shellfish that are part of our famous Lobster Bakes, they may be packed in the same box or if there wasn't room, they will be shipped separately and will arrive at the same time.
            If your order consists of frozen seafood, then the cooler may contain extra quantities of our reusable cold packs. We do not ship any products with dry ice.
